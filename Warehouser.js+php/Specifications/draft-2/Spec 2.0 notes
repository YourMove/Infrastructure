Spec 2.0 notes

1. Transparent request batching on both server and client -
client should not make unneccesary requests,
non-complient clients should still only perform 1 request per record still and duplicate results to save disk io

2. SSL support

3. Possibly a proprietary encoding - not for security but to try to encourage the use of official clients and tools, or at least well developed ones.

4. Self contained JavaScript file that is customized on deployment to match the servers configuration.

5. Implement the core schema support and schema extensions such as iterative schema's and central schema db's

6. Indexing support

7. Key and possibly cert based security
