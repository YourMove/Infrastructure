Upgrad is a tool for managing boilerplate documents within a folder.

It is designed to be non-destructive to any actual code/documentation as long as boilerplate sections are not modified by a third party.

With this tool, and the associated client - it is easy to set up your own skeleton projects and then later, modify terms, licencing and branding over time with but a click.

The use of this will be mandated for all YMI contributions, and the Contributions guide updated to reflect this.

It will also allow any compliant (using boilerplate) files to be updated manually from a designated repository (with support built into Bootstrapper) but also automatically via subscription.
