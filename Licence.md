## Iterative documentation

All documentation within sub-projects housed within the repository located at http://github.io/MJCD/YMI/ and below should be considered iterative from the highest level (http://github.io/MJCD/YMI/), with lowest levels overruling all previously defined documentation.

This specifically applies to all Licence.md, Specification.md, Contributions.md, History.md and Readme.md documents.

## Tag line

All internal files must contain one of the below licencing tags once at the start of any 'active' (non-markup) content.

* Note: Remember the 120 character line limit as per the Contribution(.md) guidelines. Considering this, the short description with 4 space (largest common) indent allows a 48 character short description.

* Comment indicating syntax below is related only for JavaScript/ECMAscript implementations. For markdown language syntax - '#' must be used instead of '//'.

## Redaction

At the express request of YourMove or it's operators - you should comply with all requests to redact data. In most cases, this will happen automatically through updates - however in certain technical cases (such as github "forks") this may require active operations. Documents will rarely be redacted - and when they do, it is usually due to internal errors (such as intra-build data loss) where the placeholder is inserted purely as an organizational substitute.
