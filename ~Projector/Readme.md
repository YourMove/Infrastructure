## Forward

Projector is a project management suite for use with YMI and affiliated projects. It is comprised of three modules..

### Boiler

Boilerplates are similar to letterhead documents. Boiler can manage your boilerplates for your code and for your technical documentation and guides - seamlessly upgrading your entire codebase AND documentation as to use a new boilerplate. This makes minor branding changes a breeze.

It can also generate new skeletons in seconds - preconfigured for use with Specifics and CaseTest (below), allowing you to get started on a new idea in moments.

Think of it for templating for the 'boring' parts of a document - so that you can spend more time doing what you care about.

### Specifics

Specifics is a tool for creating comprehensive technical specifications, sharing them through common services (google tools, outlook, etc), managing their development lifecycle including scheduling and timeframes. The goal is that with the correct specification, developing it is as easy as paint-by-numbers.

### CaseTest (CT)

CaseTest is a compliment to "Specifics" (above) - it provides case testing and results management based on Specifics documents. It can also be linked in various ways to allow hot-testing of viewers - in many cases without them even being aware of such testing occurring - or with enhanced permissions (with prompts) features such as screenshots and pixel-perfect testing (still without the user seeing this occurring).
